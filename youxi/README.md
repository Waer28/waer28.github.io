# TinyWaste

Written by my friend `mikiashiki`, a writer who's not willing to create a GitHub account.

This is an archive of TinyWaste web game. The creator is going to [shutdown the game](http://tinywaste.lofter.com/post/1dd2c191_10229739) and open source code, so I use my own account to do this.

Thanks to `mikiashiki` for created this tiny wasteland.
